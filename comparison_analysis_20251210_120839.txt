3. KEY INSIGHTS
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

a) Arrival Pattern Impact:
   - Stationary model assumes uniform arrival rate: 225/18 = 12.5 patients/hour
   - Non-stationary model has varying rates: peak 31.4/hour (12-1PM), low 2.1/hour (11PM-12AM)
   - Peak arrivals are 2.5x higher than stationary assumption in busy periods

b) Queue Dynamics:
   - Non-stationary model shows higher variability in queue lengths
   - Maximum queues occur during peak arrival periods
   - Stationary model may underestimate peak-hour congestion

c) Wait Time Analysis:
   - Trauma wait time: 13.39 min higher in non-stationary model
   - Examination wait time: 0.55 min higher in non-stationary model
   - Time-varying arrivals create temporary congestion during peaks

d) Utilization Patterns:
   - Average utilization similar between models
   - Non-stationary model has periods of over-utilization during peaks
   - Non-stationary model has periods of under-utilization during valleys

4. RECOMMENDATIONS
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

a) Staffing Strategy:
   - Non-stationary model suggests need for flexible staffing
   - Consider shift scheduling aligned with peak periods:
     * Morning shift: 6AM-2PM (covers 11AM-1PM peak)
     * Afternoon shift: 2PM-10PM (covers 5PM-7PM peak)
     * Night shift: 10PM-12AM (minimal staffing)

b) Peak Period Staffing (11AM-1PM, 5PM-7PM):
   - Add 1-2 additional staff to Examination during peaks
   - Add 1 additional staff to Registration during peaks
   - Maintain current Trauma staffing with close monitoring

c) Cost Optimization:
   - Stationary model staffing is adequate on average
   - Non-stationary model reveals opportunity for dynamic staffing
   - Potential savings: Reduce staff during low-demand periods (6-9AM, 9PM-12AM)

d) Service Level Management:
   - Both models meet overall service requirements
   - Non-stationary model shows variance in service levels by time
   - May need to define time-specific service level targets

5. STATISTICAL VALIDITY
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
   - Stationary model: 30 replications with 95% confidence intervals
   - Non-stationary model: 30 replications with 95% confidence intervals
   - Both models use common random numbers for variance reduction
   - Differences are primarily due to arrival pattern, not random variation

================================================================================
CONCLUSION
================================================================================

The non-stationary model provides a more realistic representation of clinic
operations by capturing time-varying demand patterns. Key advantages include:
  1. Better understanding of peak-period congestion
  2. Ability to design time-dependent staffing strategies
  3. More accurate capacity planning for specific time periods
  4. Identification of under-utilized capacity during low-demand hours

Recommendation: Use non-stationary model for operational decisions and
shift scheduling. Use stationary model for initial capacity estimates and
strategic planning where average behavior is sufficient.
